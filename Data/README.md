## Dataset Source

The dataset used in this project can be downloaded from Figshare:

**Title:** Predicting energy cost from wearable sensors: A dataset of energetic and physiological wearable sensor data from healthy individuals performing multiple physical activities  
**Authors:** Kimberly A. Ingraham, Daniel P. Ferris, and C. David Remy  
**DOI:** [https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/Predicting_energy_cost_from_wearable_sensors_A_dataset_of_energetic_and_physiological_wearable_sensor_data_from_healthy_individuals_performing_multiple_physical_activities/7473191](https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/Predicting_energy_cost_from_wearable_sensors_A_dataset_of_energetic_and_physiological_wearable_sensor_data_from_healthy_individuals_performing_multiple_physical_activities/7473191)

## ⚙️ Data Preparation

The Figshare dataset contains raw sensor data.  
Before using it, the data should be **cleaned and preprocessed** as described in the original paper:

> *Ingraham, K. A., Ferris, D. P., & Remy, C. D. (2019). Evaluating physiological signal salience for estimating metabolic energy cost from wearable sensors.*

After preprocessing, each subject’s data should be saved as a **CSV file** with the following structure:

| Column | Description | Type |
|--------|--------------|------|
| Time (s) | Time in seconds | float |
| Interpolated Values_Waist Acceleration | Waist acceleration | float |
| Interpolated Values_Chest Acceleration | Chest acceleration | float |
| Interpolated Values_Left Ankle Acceleration | Left ankle acceleration | float |
| Interpolated Values_right Ankle Acceleration | Right ankle acceleration | float |
| Interpolated_Left Leg (1–7) | Left leg kinematic features | float |
| Interpolated_Right Leg (1–7) | Right leg kinematic features | float |
| Interpolated_gaussian_EMG_magnitude_left/right | EMG signal magnitudes | float |
| Interpolated Values_left/right wrist Acceleration | Wrist accelerations | float |
| Interpolated Values_left/right wrist electrodermal | EDA (electrodermal activity) | float |
| Interpolated Values_left/right wrist Temperature | Skin temperature | float |
| Interpolated Values_VO2 | Oxygen consumption | float |
| Interpolated Values_Breath Frequency | Breathing frequency | float |
| Interpolated Values_Minute Ventilation | Minute ventilation | float |
| Interpolated Values_SpO2 | Blood oxygen saturation | float |
| Interpolated Values_Heart Rate | Heart rate | float |
| Interpolated Values_Energy expenditures | Energy expenditure | float |
| Activity Code | Encoded activity type | int |

Each preprocessed CSV file will contain **36 columns** and approximately **6488 rows** (per subject).
